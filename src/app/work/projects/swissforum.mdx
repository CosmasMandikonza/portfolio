# Educational Access Initiative

## Overview
A collaborative project developed at the International Swiss Talent Forum 2024, addressing the critical challenge of accessing high-quality educational materials in developing countries.

## Problem Statement
Despite initiatives offering special access to individuals from certain countries and an increasing number of open-access journals, the process remains complex and often leads to confusion and exclusion.

## Solution
Created a unified directory of open-access resources and modifications to existing resources, championing accessible, legal, and high-quality educational materials for all students.

## Impact
- Improved accessibility to educational resources globally
- Enhanced awareness of available open-access materials
- Streamlined access to academic content
